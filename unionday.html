        <p class="uni-text">
          Union Day commemorates the 1947 Panglong Conference, which took place
          in the months preceding the country’s independence from the British.
          According to accounts, the conference in the hill town of Panglong was
          crucial in bringing the country’s varied multi-ethnic people together
          to form a cohesive and eventually sovereign nation. <br /><br />
          Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) came under British administration in
          1886, but the British drew a distinction between how central Burma was
          governed and how various ethnic groups in the surrounding areas were
          governed.
          <br /><br />
          Following the end of WWII, General Aung San, the interim Burmese
          government’s leader, convened at Panglong with leaders from the Shan
          states, the Kachin hills, and the Chin hills to discuss Burma’s
          future. They came to an agreement on February 12, 1947, which was
          signed and passed. The agreement reunited Burma and required that the
          British administration grant all of Burma its freedom.
          <br /><br />
          The Panglong Agreement was signed by Aung San, Myanmar’s national hero
          and interim president, as well as a few ethnic minority leaders who
          agreed to join the Union of Burma in return for federal authority.
          <br /><br />
          The agreement was a watershed moment in Myanmar’s history since it
          paved the way for Burma’s independence in January 1948. The agreement
          also gave ethnic leaders the option of seceding from the union if they
          were unhappy with the new nation.
          <br /><br />
          Aung San, on the other hand, did not live to see Burma attain
          independence. He was killed on July 19, 1947, just months before the
          country gained independence. Then, in 1962, a military coup ushered in
          nearly half a century of army dictatorship. Burma was renamed Myanmar
          by the military government in 1989.
